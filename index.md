## Introduction
In his article “The Complexity of Dance Choreography Procedures”, Nigel Gwee seeks to define the complexity of dance choreography.

## Background Information
## Decision Problems
### Hamiltonian Circuits (HC)
```markdown
```
### Dance Choreography (DC)
```markdown
```
### Dance Choreography k (DCk)
```markdown
```

## Optimization Problems
We make the transition from decision problems to optimization problems with the help of the problem DCk, which is shown above. 

Here optimization is based on set cardinality. In other words, the most optimum solution is that with the most variation in the figures. 
### Dance Choreography Optimization (DCO)
```markdown
We show that DCO is NP-hard through showing that DCk, which is NP-complete, is Turing reducible to DCO.

Let max be the optimal solution for an instance of DCO, where max = |{f1, .. fn}|. 

The Turing Machine would appear as the following:
For an instance of DCk:
k ≤ max → yes 
Else →  no

```
## Real World Applications

## Evaluation
The way that the author defined dance, as a series of figures that could or could not be connected in different ways was very clever. It allowed it to take a form distinctly related to graphs, which made the proof process much easier.

However, dance is an art not a science and it follows from that that an optimized order of figures probably won’t automatically make the best dance routine.
