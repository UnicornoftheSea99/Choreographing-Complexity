## Introduction
In his article “The Complexity of Dance Choreography Procedures”, Nigel Gwee seeks to define the complexity of dance choreography.

## Real World Applications

## Evaluation
The way that the author defined dance, as a series of figures that could or could not be connected in different ways was very clever. It allowed it to take a form distinctly related to graphs, which made the proof process much easier.

However, dance is an art not a science and it follows from that that an optimized order of figures probably won’t automatically make the best dance routine.
